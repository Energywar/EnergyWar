Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------
After all the "RAPL_README" was checked it will be explained the way to use RAPL to test the energy consumed of the browsers.


How to Use
--------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use the program, the console must be with superuser permissions so before run the "main.java" it is necessary run any command with sudo, for example:

```
sudo ls
```

After that its possible to execute the "main.java" and it take as argument the name of the script and the time it tooks the script


```
java main ch_insta_10 10
```


The outputs will be written in "Resultados" 



Beware this only works if RAPL is working in your system.
